- When created Ids to pass to as parameters makes sure they are not the same within the same test so the tests will catch any wrongly passed parameters.
- When passing Ids to a constructor or method, dont use magic numbers, create a const or named variable for the Ids.
- There exist Fakers for the Domain entities, use them to create the entities for the tests.
  Use the RuleFor method to set the properties of the entity that is relavant in the tests.
- Skip any method just returning an Dto from a repository.
- Also dont use the var keyword.
- Dont test logger mock.
- When a mock should return a null value, use the ! operator to make it explicit and silence warnings.
